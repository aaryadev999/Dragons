             <h2> Book 1 Prolouge </h2>
             
             <h5>Rain poured down on all of Crynasia and dragons were in their homes but one restless mother was waiting for her beloved egg to hatch. “Be patient dear, that egg will hatch someday” said a male dragon. “Be patient?! I have been waiting eternity for the egg to hatch Darkjaw!” said a female. Darkjaw yelped. He knew Divine had been waiting for more than 50 years for the egg to hatch. How to make her wait a little longer? No actually a lot longer. Thought Darkjaw. “Well now you don't have a reason to stall me do you!” Divine snapped. How does she know?! Darkjaw panicked. “Your fellow sidekick spilled the information!” Divine laughed. Darkjaw couldn’t believe Haze could do that! “That backstabbing little toad faced imbecile!” growled Darkjaw. Then a little dragon with spikes along his back abruptly landed into the treetop hut. “That is not a good way to describe a friend” said Haze. “There you are, you TRAITOR!” and with that Darkjaw threw himself at Haze. They growled and breathed lava at each other but closely missed each other. “ENOUGH!” thundered Divine. “You’re acting like Drool Tails!” They stared at Divine with lava growing under their breath. Then they circled her, And pounced at her from both sides and then the fight started.</h5>
